          My goal is to become a full-stack web developer. I am really working
          hard to reach my goal. Every day I learn a new concept and practice
          that concept by doing some small project. In this way, I can easily
          memorize my old studies too. Currently I am learning React JS. After
          that, I will start to learn Laravel. Whenever I get some free time, I
          read programming-related documentation and journals. In order to
          maintain my time management, I made a daily routine that I try to
          follow regularly. By doing all this hopefully, I will achieve my goal.
